# LUVE Project State

## 1. Current Expected Git State

* **Clean Worktree:** `git status --short` should be empty (clean) after committing these docs.
* **Latest runtime/tooling baseline:** `c5cf2c3` — test(grading-worker): add completed session backfill script.
* **Source of Truth:** All python services runtime files in `services/core-api/` and `services/grading-worker/` are untouched, matching the local baseline.

## 2. Latest Important Commits

* `c5cf2c3` - test(grading-worker): add completed session backfill script (dry-run-first, USER_TURN filter, idempotent upsert).
* `9ec6c05` - docs(ai): add Claude coding guardrails (CLAUDE.md with LUVE-specific priority header).
* `aa8a9e9` - docs(ai): add Claude Code handoff state.
* `795fafe` - fix(core-api): reuse RabbitMQ session event publisher (Lazy connection/channel caching).
* `0c09f5b` - test(core-api): improve stress harness cooldown checks (Adds cooldown snapshots before CPU idle verification).
* `bddfa10` - test(core-api): add realtime WebRTC stress harness (Adds `scripts/realtime_stress.py`).
* `ff5d316` - chore(core-api): add TEN runtime health diagnostics (Adds `GET /rtc/health`).

## 3. Verified Reliability Evidence (Local/Dev)

* **`noise` STT-only (no TTS):** 10/10 runs successfully passed.
* **`short_english` LLM (no TTS):** 10/10 runs successfully passed.
* **`short_english` LLM+TTS:** 5/5 runs successfully passed.
* **TTS long-drain:** 5/5 runs successfully passed (verified `active_sessions_after_cooldown=0` and low CPU usage after cooldown).
* **RabbitMQ Resiliency:**
  * **UP test:** Completed sessions are successfully published to `luve.session.completed`.
  * **DOWN test:** Session end and database persistence complete successfully with grace when Broker is down; publish fails non-blocking on best-effort timeout.
  * **RECOVERY test:** Session completion publishing resumes instantly and successfully once RabbitMQ comes back online.

## 4. Grading Backfill Execution Evidence (Local/Dev)

* **Initial audit counts:** `completed_sessions=218`, `grading_results=2`, `completed_missing_grading=216`.
* **Backfill runs:** Executed in controlled increments (`--limit 1`, `5`, `20`, `50`, `50`) against local Postgres with default filters (raw_backup_json IS NOT NULL + at least one accepted USER_TURN).
* **Final DB state after full backfill:**
  * `grading_results` total: **138**
  * `completed_missing_grading`: **80**
  * Remaining 80 sessions all have `raw_backup_json IS NULL` (no event log; not eligible for default backfill).
  * `missing_has_raw=0`: no eligible sessions with event data were skipped.
* **Idempotency verified:** Rerun targeting an already-graded session produced `candidates_seen=0`; no duplicate row was created. The `LEFT JOIN … gr.session_id IS NULL` filter in the candidate query excluded it before any grading logic ran.
* **Backfill filter confirmed:** Default filter correctly excluded empty/noise/rapid-disconnect stress sessions with no accepted speech turns.

## 5. Known Limitations & Gaps

* **No Durable Outbox:** If RabbitMQ is down when a session finishes, the session event is not persisted locally for later retry; future sessions will miss grading until manually backfilled again.
* **Backfill Script (dev-only):** `services/grading-worker/scripts/backfill_completed_sessions.py` exists and is verified, but is a manual dev-ops tool, not a production recovery mechanism.
* **80 Sessions with NULL raw_backup_json:** These sessions are completed but have no event log. Root cause (e.g., empty stress sessions, sessions that ended before any STT was accepted) is not yet audited. They are not eligible for default backfill.
* **Connection Shutdown:** `close_publisher()` exists but is not wired into the application shutdown lifecycles; TEN gateway shutdown may print robust connection warning logs.
* **Grading Worker:** Currently uses a simulated fake grader instead of final pedagogical grading.
* **VAD & Whisper Warm Policy:** Changing VAD thresholds or disabling Whisper unload is high risk; these changes are not current next tasks.
* **Not Production-Ready:** Code is tuned for local single-session correctness and local stress verification; do not claim production scale.
